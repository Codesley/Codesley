### Hello! 👋

My name is Kingsley and I recently made the switch to software engineering! Before I had a background in customer service and healthcare. I have a deep love for building; from legos, to computers, and even keyboards, I am passionate about seeing projects grow from start to end.

Some things I'm interested in:
- 📱 Tech 
- 🎮 Video games
- 🏋🏻 Powerlifting
- 🏀 Basketball
